# 👋  Welcome to my GitHub

##  About Me

🎓 I'm passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. My goal is to become an **AI Engineer** or **Data Scientist**.

📂 I continuously learn through tutorials, online courses, and hands-on projects. I use this GitHub to share my **notebooks**, **scripts**, **LaTeX reports**, and experiments.

🛠️ This profile is my personal lab for learning, improving, and sharing.
